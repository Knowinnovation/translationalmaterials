            <h2>Really Cool Headline should go here!</h2>

            <h4>Join our virutal innovation lab to develop novel cross-disciplinary collaborations!</h4>

            
            
            <p>This is a Conference proposal for an NSF Convergence Accelerator Workshop on the topic of “Accelerating Translational Materials R&D for Global Challenges” to be held in May 2021 as part of the NSF Convergence Accelerator program.  If selected, this workshop would provide a technical report in mid-2021 to identify Convergence Accelerator proposals for 2022 Cohort Tracks G&H </h3>
            <p><strong>The event will be held online, and will take place May XXXX 2021. &mdash;</strong></p>
            <
            <h3>Motivation</h3>
            <p>Many global challenges need materials innovation.  This includes first-order innovations that create new industries (carbon capture, nitrogen fixation, novel thermoelectrics) and also second-order innovations to transform existing industries (novel energy storage chemistries, light-weight structural materials).  Technologies like artificial intelligence and quantum computing are showing the potential to significantly increase the pace of fundamental materials discovery.  These innovations need to be combined with global scale – economic analysis, piloting, scale-up, lifecycle analysis, and adoption.  Putting all these pieces together successfully is a complex challenge that involves not just academia but also industrial, government, and non-profit entities.
 </p>
 


<h3>The Process</h3>
            <p>This will be a multi-stakeholder workshop targeting approximately 50 participants to be held over three days on separate weeks in May 2021.  Each day will consist of a pre-read of 3-4 brief recorded presentations from experts in the field, a panel discussion/Q&A with the recorded speakers, and facilitated ideation sessions to identify roadblocks to materials innovation, collect visionary suggestions, aggregate ideas, and develop community actions for progress.  The three days of the workshop will be roughly split into the themes of discovery, development, and impact.
</p>


</p>

            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>The formal outcome of the Workshop will be a technical report submitted to NSF.  However, the deeper goal of the Workshop is the development of a broad-based materials innovation community that takes a holistic view of materials science, technology, and social impact and that brings together diverse participants to nucleate working groups focused around specific global challenges.
</p>


<p>Approximately 50 participants will be selected to participate in the workshop on the basis of the interests, expertise, and other characteristics. Most participants are expected to be academic faculty, from early career to senior investigators. Original thinkers from outside academia are also encouraged to apply. When selecting participants, consideration will be given to balance across a range of diverse disciplinary experience and expertise. All participants should be willing to engage in frank discussion and assessment of ideas in a collegial and professional fashion. To facilitate open sharing, all meeting discussions will be considered a private communication and not to be shared outside of the meeting, unless approved by the contributor. </p>
